Aboriginal Lattice Structure 

  Lattice organizations are flat and are designed to foster personal initiative. Many define a lattice structure as a place with no traditional
organizational charts, no chains of command and no predetermined channels of communication. 

  Our model is modified to include a system of peer review by organically developed groups of specialists. Encouraging hands on innovation as well as 
significant associate personal satisfaction.  Many times clique like behaviour will emerge; damaging the  horizontal structure. 

Traditionally, this problem has already been confronted and resolved in many ways by First Nations People. 


    Native American Indegenous thinking has been consider more along ethno cultural lines then a principles of operation.
    It has been focused along political autonomy, contemporary experience, colonialism and ethicity. This is a mistake
    because there are so much data for organizational methodologies. Methodologies that that or only now emerging.

    Being "Indegenous in a Bottle" ignores the experience and principles that can/have to great knowledge.

    "Mice Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy" - let us consider the North American Indegenous Community as an Open Source Project.

    Dodems:

     "In his essay "Le Totémisme aujourd’hui" (Totemism Today), the anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss argued that human cognition, which is based on
     analogical thought, is independent of social context. From this, he excludes mathematical thought, which operates primarily through logic.
     Lévi-Strauss argues that the use of physical analogies is not an indication of a more primitive mental capacity. It is, rather, a more efficient
     way to cope with this particular mode of life in which abstractions are rare, and in which the physical environment is in direct friction with the
     society. He also holds that scientific explanation entails the discovery of an "arrangement";
    
     moreover, since "the science of the concrete" is a classificatory system enabling individuals to classify the world in a rational fashion,
     it is neither more nor less a science than any other in the western world. Lévi-Strauss diverts the theme of anthropology
     toward the understanding of human cognition." - Wikipedia  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totem)

   Totems and clans where applied in different fashions. From heriditary membership to self assignment.  Living based on what was
   as opposed to thinking for yourself is not cultural as a bias. It is simple romanticism and conservatism, which has its place 
   but is not unquestionable in anyway.

   To that end, both have been adopted in this system. This is only possible because of the ability for people to migrate from 
   group to group.

   This is refelected in Open Source Project types.

   Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL) - a common type of software development leadership structure that can be seen
   as simliar to heriditary chiefs in the plains nations.

   Plains nations had the option of leaving or moving away. Which means things that did not work could be abandoned.
   Meritocratic Leadership is fundamental to opensource software and it is organizated in the same manner.

   The Great Law Of Peace:

     There are countless examples of OpenSource commmunities that have used this effect to great measure.
     Things however become more complicated when a collections of such communities interact.  


   Council Fires:


   Grand Council Fires:



  When things go wrong:

   Dropping the Black Wumpum:

      Declaring war and dehorning leaders. 
         There are times when migration is not enough

       While the seed content for this project started from the Great Law Of Peace

  Principles:


   Representation By Number of Clans over Populism:

    Wisdom of Crowds:

     "Story of the Ox" - crowds are have information but it needs to be sorted.



   Agency:

  Self Association based on interactions that would iteratively achieve a social objective.

  Imagine if Anarchism had over 5000+ years to mature.  Beyond Anarchism it would be a method of using iterative interactions to achieve a 
desired state of being. It was medicine it was not simply a political law that was handed from up high on tablets.

 It is what would happend of anarxhost lived thier ideals foe 5000+ years
There is an objectively competitive narrative. It is data collected not habits.   Not a magic Indian but a thinking one
Blood is an colonial way. It was about the reality of the way itself.  About the medicine.  Lol that is my opinion.

   White Pine Network in a Box:

     The protocols of this methodology will be applied to a series of smart contracts, so that this process can work autonomously.


  Collection of ETHERUM smart contracts that create decentralized company inspired by North American Aboriginal political science.
This project was originally developed in house policy at EMRIS Creative Core www.emris.cc
