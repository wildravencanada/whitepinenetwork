Aboriginal Lattice Structure 

Lattice organizations are flat and are designed to foster personal initiative. Many define a lattice structure as a place with no traditional organizational charts, no chains of command and no predetermined channels of communication. 

Our model is modified to include a system of peer review by organically developed groups of specialists. Encouraging hands on innovation as well as significant associate personal satisfaction. Many times clique like behaviour will emerge; damaging the  horizontal structure. Traditionally, this problem has already been confronted and resolved in many ways by First Nations People. 

As such, we have included a variation on the Ojibway dodem(kinship) system. We call them Associations.

Everyone can earn the credibility to define and drive projects. This will help associates chart a course in the organization that will offer personal fulfilment while maximizing their contribution to the enterprise. Personal development is an integral community experience. 

  Leadership: 

Leaders may be appointed, but are defined by 'followership.' More often, leaders emerge naturally by demonstrating special knowledge, skill, or experience that advances a business objective. 

   We have adopted three basic principles of association:: 

Fairness to each other and everyone with whom we come in contact 
Freedom to encourage, help, and allow other associates to grow in knowledge, skill, and scope of responsibility 
The ability to make one's own commitments and keep them in Consultation with other associates/associations before undertaking actions that could impact the reputation of the company. 
   
EMRIS Associations (dodem):

 Ogimma (chief,leader,rep): Responsible for consultation with other clans before undertaking actions that could impact the reputation of the company; collecting the approval of a representative from each clan member before under taking this action.
 An ogimma is created when a member of all 5 Associations recommends and individual. The grand fire (board of directors) will then approve them or, alternatively, offer the title as necessary. The title will be valid of a 1-2 year period, subject to renewal.


  
Associates can join an Association (see Operational Plan).
Each Association will send a representative to attend meeting of the board. Business functions, such as HR, PR, and marketing are dealt with centrally by the board of directors.
